What is this madness?
=====================

Hello! I (@pseale on twitter) wrote this.

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2016 solutions.

I'm proud of how day 8 turned out (demo it here: [http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bBOZXO](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bBOZXO)). For all other solutions, assume I'm ashamed of them in at least one aspect. Some solutions I overengineered, some I didn't overengineer enough.

While working through these problems, I learned a lot of TypeScript, some JavaScript, even some HTML.

When solving advent of code problems, most people write the smallest chunk of ugly, minimally-functional code that solves the problem. My solutions are often exercises or mini-experiments, and so they'll usually look overengineered. I solved days 13 and 15 as fast and minimally as possible--so if you're looking to be reassured that I can write code without ceremony, look in days 13 and 15.

Enjoy. I have been very pleasantly surprised by TypeScript.


Can I run `npm install` to run your solutions?
----------------------------------------------

Sorry, no. As a consolation prize, know that I'm ashamed that I didn't properly `--save` my packages. But also know that I'm not ashamed enough to fix them.
